Overview

This repository contains comprehensive notes and code samples focused on mastering web automation using Selenium 4.x and Java. It covers setups, automation techniques, test frameworks, and advanced browser automation practices for real-world projects.
Features

    Detailed coverage of Selenium WebDriver Architecture

    Comparison: Selenium vs Playwright vs Cypress

    WebDriver setup for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari

    Locators: XPath, CSS Selectors, and Relative Locators

    Synchronization: Explicit, Implicit, Fluent Waits

    Working with HTML Forms, Web Tables, Alerts, Windows, and iFrames

    Data-driven-testing using Apache POI

    Page Object Model and Page Factory implementation

    Integrations: Allure Reporting, Jenkins, Docker, AWS

    Advanced topics: Shadow DOM, SVG Automation, Actions class

    Logging with Log4j2

    Maven and TestNG configuration

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Java 8+

    Maven

    ChromeDriver/GeckoDriver/EdgeDriver

    IntelliJ/Eclipse IDE

    TestNG & Allure

    Apache POI

Installation

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/selenium-4-web-automation-notes.git
cd selenium-4-web-automation-notes

Add required drivers and dependencies based on your OS and browser choice.
Key Concepts

    Selenium WebDriver Architecture: Understand how Selenium communicates directly via browser drivers.

    Locators: Master XPath, CSS selectors, and all types (id, name, class, link text, etc.).

    Wait Strategies: Implement best practices for dynamic and Ajax-powered pages.

    Page Object Model: Write maintainable, scalable automation tests.

    Exception Handling: Manage Selenium exceptions like NoSuchElement, TimeoutException, etc.

    Framework Features: Thread safety with ThreadLocal, reporting, external config with property files.

Assignments & Demos

Example assignments:

    Automate VWO Login Page: Valid/Invalid login, error validation, dashboard verification

    Web Table Automation: Extract data, dynamic XPath, Google tables, pagination handling

    SVG & Shadow DOM: Locate and interact with complex UI components

    Handle Alerts, Radio Buttons, Dropdowns, Windows, iframes

Sample automation code and assignment solutions are available in /examples and /assignments folders.

bash
# To run a sample TestNG suite
mvn test

# To view Allure reports
allure serve allure-results/
