Task 21st Aug 2025 | Learn HTML Basic+ Create HTML Form

I want all of you to create an HTML form. It's like a registration form, which will have the first name, last name. It will have a radio box for male and female. It will also have an anchor tag, which is a link. And then it will also store the age. What you need to do is you need to create this HTML file and upload and host it.
